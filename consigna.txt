Seatmap Availability Exercise:

Our goal is to parse seatmap information from XML files and create a JSON format that our customers can parse 
so that they can display any airline seatmap by integrating our format.

Desired behavior:

    Input: python seatmap_parser.py [FILENAME]
    Output: FILENAME_parsed.JSON

Description:

Write a python script that parses the XML seatmap files included in this folder (seatmap1.xml, seatmap2.xml) 
into a standardized JSON format that outputs the seatmap (by row) with the following properties at minimum:

    - Seat/Element type (Seat, Kitchen, Bathroom, etc.)
    - Seat id (17A, 18A)
    - Seat price
    - Cabin class
    - Availability
